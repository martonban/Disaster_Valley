This is a very simple 2D game project implemented using LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library), focusing on basic 2D graphics. The engine's foundation is built upon the tutorial series available at <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyKE7vz65rY&list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE">this link</a>. After completing the texture and spritesheet systems following the tutorial, I continued the development independently without any guidance.<br>

I created a simple animation system, a tilemap system, and a collision box system (which is functional but not yet fully integrated into the game). Controlling the little character is done using the WASD keys. You can watch a short video showcasing the current state of the "game" <a href = "https://twitter.com/marton_ban/status/1671891792416104448">here</a>.

Please note that I have decided not to continue working on this project because it is a 2D Java game.<br>
