# Disaster_Valley
This is a LWJGL Stardew Valley Clone. The reason why it's a disaster because i am going to try make a game without any tutorial or guidance. This game is a simple 2D game. You can controll your player with your keyboard. The player has animatition, based on your movement. 

I implemeted a Tile Map System where the engine is read from a file and it can draw every needed sprites from a Spritesheet.
