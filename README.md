This is a very simple LWJGL 2D game project, where I implemented the basic of the 2D graphics. The basics of the engine is based on <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyKE7vz65rY&list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE">this</a> tutorial series. After the texture and spritesheet systems i started my little game. I did a simple animation system, with tilemap system too. And in the end I did a collision box system.
